# IOC_Validator
This is a tool created to automate the process of scraping Indicators of Compromises (IOCs) from a website. This script allows a person to enter the path of a text file containing various URLs seperated by new line characters. The script automatically creates folders for each URL and then creates different text files for each IOC type with the IOCs listed within it. Read the instruction guide for more help. Follow the instructions below to use the script.

`git clone https://github.com/Alissa-lim/IOC_Validator.git`<br/>
`cd IOC_Validator`<br/>
`pip install requirements.txt`<br/>
`python IOC_Validator.py`<br/>

Then follow the instructions once the script is executed.
